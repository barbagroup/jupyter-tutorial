The \"Daring Fireball\" (by John Gruber) [markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) page is a nice starting point or reference."

It is the simplest way to share a notebook with anyone: just host the notebook file (`.ipynb` extension) online and enter the public URL to the file on the **nbviewer** _Go!_ box.
